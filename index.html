        <div class="subheading mb-5">Finance üìàüí≤</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, My name is Carlos Palazuelos. I am a first generation student who is pursuing a business administration major. My plan is to concentrate on Finance and hopefully minor in Economics.
I come from the small town of Arroyo Grande which is located in San Luis Obispo County. It is a relatively unknown town located near the coast, with a total population of around 15k. It has one high school, Arroyo Grande High, which is where I spent four years and graduated in 2020. My original plan, and what most students at my highschool end up doing is attending Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, our local university. Yet, I didn‚Äôt really want to stay back home and wanted to go out of my comfort zone. This put me on a path and led me to my eventual decision to join UC Riverside.<br>
<br>Along with that I have feel that I have high and wanted experience for many employers. My first job was at a local restaurant as a busser. As my first job, I did not expect much, this led me into a good experience working there as everything was new to me. I worked there for just a couple of months as I later got an opportunity which I felt would be better for me and my growth. That opportunity was to work at a golf store as an intern greenskeeper. Since I already had a job I went in much more ‚Äúexpected.‚Äù While the jobs were very different, I enjoyed this one more. I felt much more comfortable and in enjoyment with my responsibilities. I felt I took more duties under my mantel, yet I was more stress free. I would drive around the course in a golf cart making sure that it was up to the standards that our guests expected after so many years. <br>
<br>Lastly I would like to talk about what I want and look forward to in my future. Obviously as I stated previously I am a business major who is hoping to concentrate in finance. Yet, with this I don‚Äôt just want to stick to a 9 - 5 job. I have ready multiple books on accountancy and wealth, and I would like to not just have one but several different forms of disposable income. I want to branch out and at some point hopefully start my own business. Now, with that being said, I don't want to rule out any possibilities and I am open to explore doors and change. Positions such as upper management of overseeing my own projects are both things that interest me. I have not decided which sector of business I would like to end in or which I would like to specialize, but I do have a number of ideas. This includes the more obvious tech field, but also others that I enjoy such as the environmental field and also the agricultural field. Ultimately, I will follow the opportunities that arise and I am not afraid to look into or out of what I would consider the ordinary. <br>
